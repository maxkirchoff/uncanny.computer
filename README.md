# Basic Bro!

Copied from [FastShell](https://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell) which was inspired by [FireShell](http://getfireshell.com)

This is just a project to have a simple Sass, HTML5, and JS boilerplate that used livereload-like functionality. This is not intended to be better than the projects it is based on. I've purposely removed some of the really cool, opinionated parts of FastShell. Please check out that project if you want a real framework.

## Start Building

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html) and [Git](http://git-scm.com).
2. [Install Gulp](http://Gulpjs.com/) Easiest way is `npm install -g gulp`.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `gulp dev` to start developing, which automatically opens the project on `localhost:3002`.
5. Run `gulp` to package files (if not using `gulp dev`) into `app` for upload to your server or filestore.
